# MD5 Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of the MD5 algorithm, developed as part of the Data Security course at the Federal Institute of Para√≠ba (IFPB). The project was developed using the object-oriented programming paradigm in Python.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to provide a practical understanding of the MD5 hash algorithm and demonstrate the application of object-oriented programming principles in a data security context.

## Description

The MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit hash value from an input message of any length, commonly represented as a 32-character hexadecimal number. Despite known vulnerabilities, MD5 remains an important algorithm for studying and understanding hashing and data security techniques.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **md5.py**: Implementation of the MD5 algorithm.
- **tests.py**: Tests to validate the implementation.
